### Workflow
**Inserting the Necessary Library:**
  To insert the Necessary library, first import the library, if not the library is imported then just install the library by using below code.
        !pip install [library name].
  Here I have imported the libraries by using the below code.
        import os
        import json
        import pandas as pd
        import mysql.connector as sql
        import streamlit as st
        import plotly.express as px


  **Importing the Libraries:**
 
   Importing the libraries. As I have already mentioned above the list of libraries/modules needed for the project. First we have to import all those libraries. If the libraries are not installed already use the below piece of code to install.
